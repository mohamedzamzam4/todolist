This project is a sample To-Do list application built with React. It allows users to:

Add new tasks using a form
Edit existing tasks
Delete tasks as needed

The application stores tasks in the browser's local storage, allowing tasks to persist even after the page is refreshed. Task data is initially loaded from local storage into the application's state, ensuring the task list is up-to-date whenever the app is opened.
